🎵 AI Music Generator 🎶 | Django-Based Web App
Welcome to the AI Music Generator, a Django-powered web application that uses artificial intelligence to create music based on user-selected genres, moods, or prompts. This project showcases the intersection of AI, music creativity, and web development using modern technologies.

🚀 Features
🎼 Generate music with AI based on user input (e.g., mood, genre, or prompt)

🧠 Integrates AI/ML models to create music sequences

🎹 Option to play, download, or save generated music

🌐 Clean, responsive UI built with Django and Bootstrap/CSS

🗃️ User-friendly interface to manage generated tracks

🎧 Real-time audio playback with waveform visuals (optional)

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Django (Python)

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch / Music21 / Magenta (based on your implementation)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Tools: SQLite / PostgreSQL, Django Admin, Git

📦 Installation
bash

📁 Project Structure
music_ai/ – Django project files

generator/ – App for AI music generation

templates/ – HTML templates

static/ – CSS, JS, audio player

models/ – AI/ML model files

media/ – User-generated music files

🧠 How It Works
User selects a genre/mood or enters a custom prompt.

Backend processes input and feeds it to an AI music generation model.

The model returns a MIDI/audio file.

File is converted (if needed), saved, and played on the frontend.

📌 Future Enhancements
🎤 Voice-to-music conversion

🧑‍🎤 User accounts & playlists

☁️ Cloud deployment (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

🎨 Audio visualizer and waveform animations
